# Image Manipulation Program for CSPB 1300

## Overview

This project was the culmination of our C++ learning in the CSPB 1300 course at CU Boulder. The goal was to implement 10 functions of image manipulation with the sample code given and then create a UI for the user to give commands through. This was a cool project and a great learning experience in my programming journey!

## Features

- **Image Manipulation:** Perform various image manipulation tasks such as adjusting colors, applying filters, and more.
- **User Interface:** Simple UI for the user to give commands and interact with the program.
- **File Handling:** Efficient handling and processing of image files.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed the latest version of a C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang).
- You have basic knowledge of C++ and command-line interface.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd your-repo
   ```

## Usage

To run this program, follow these steps:

1. **Compile the Program:**

   Use a C++ compiler to compile the program. For example, using g++:

   ```sh
   g++ -o ImageManipulation ImageManipulation_main.cpp
   ```

2. **Run the Program:**

   Execute the compiled program:

   ```sh
